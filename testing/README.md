# TESTING
- Would create a Postman collection that includes requests for each use case and edge case (to be executed & verified manually)
- Later, automate in Postman
- Possibly add Newman cli steps to CI/CD pipeline to execute requests and assert expectations programatically  

## e2e testing
- Coming from an Angular background, I'm familiar with Protractor and Cypress for e2e testing
- Assuming there is a client-side application for this, you can e2e test with these tools to confirm API is being consumed without issue
