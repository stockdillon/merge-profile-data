Considerations
The following questions are things to consider while designing your solution; the goal is not to provide a fully implemented solution for this exercise, but instead to go
down the design process far enough to be ready to talk about:
1. How would you structure your code? - [link](structure/README.md)  
2. How efficient is your design?
3. How would you handle versions of external APIs; are some versions better suited to solve our problem?
4. How would you approach testing this design?
5. What are the steps you would take to solve the problem?
6. What questions do you have about the requirements?
7. Assuming we want to bring this service live to be used by customers, what additional work would you want to do before launch?
