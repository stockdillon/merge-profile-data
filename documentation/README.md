Considerations
The following questions are things to consider while designing your solution; the goal is not to provide a fully implemented solution for this exercise, but instead to go
down the design process far enough to be ready to talk about:
1. [How would you structure your code?](structure/README.md)  
2. [How efficient is your design?](efficiency/README.md)  
3. [How would you handle versions of external APIs; are some versions better suited to solve our problem?](versions/README.md)  
4. [How would you approach testing this design?](testing/README.md)  
5. [What are the steps you would take to solve the problem?](solution/README.md)
6. [What questions do you have about the requirements?](questions/README.md)
7. [Assuming we want to bring this service live to be used by customers, what additional work would you want to do before launch?](todo/README.md)
