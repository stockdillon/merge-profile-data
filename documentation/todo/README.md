# TODO
- Auth
	- Some GitHub details require authentication, complicating our API significantly
	- Store auth tokens for all services
- Validation
	- what happens when fields are missing or invalid?
- Error Handling
	- 404 errors when source service cannot locate resource
	- 500 internal server errors 
	- meta fields: status, error, message (UI)
- Add meta data for each class
    - i.e. `href` for location of resources within our API
- Documentation
    - PEP8 doc strings in classes/functions
    - OpenAPI yaml definition of API request/respones schemas
    - UML class hierarchy diagram
- Visitor pattern for aggregation
    - One concrete visitor for each aggregated property (e.g. follower count, languages, etc)
        - Concrete visitor has method for each source type (GitHub Organization, BitBucket Team, etc)
        - Profile class simple adds or combines the respective properties from each source, after they have accepted the visitors
